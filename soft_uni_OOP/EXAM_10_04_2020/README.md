*Aquariums are nice and interesting species can live in there. You have to create an aqua shop project, which keeps track of the fish in the aquariums. The Aquariums have Fish with different environment requirements. Your task is to add, feed and take care of the fish.*

You will be provided with a skeleton which includes all the folders and files that you will need. 
###### Note: You are not allowed to change the folder and file structure and change their names!

## Structure (Problem 1) and Functionality (Problem 2) - [Solution](https://github.com/borislavstoychev/Soft_Uni/tree/master/soft_uni_OOP/EXAM_10_04_2020/aqua_shop_project/project)
Our first task is to implement the structure and functionality of all the classes (properties, methods, inheritance, etc.)
##    1. BaseDecoration
In the base_decoration.py file the class BaseDecoration should be implemented. It is a base class of any type of decoration, and it should not be able to be instantiated.
### Structure
#### The class should have the following attributes:
    • comfort: int - passed upon initialization. 
    • price: float - passed upon initialization.
### Methods
```__init__(comfort: int, price: float)```

The __init__ method should have a comfort and price. 

##    2. Ornament
In the file ornament.py the class Ornament should be implemented.
Structure
The class should inherit from the BaseDecoration class.
### Methods
```__init__()```

An instance of the Ornament class will have 1 comfort and its price is 5.

##    3. Plant
In the file plant.py the class Plant should be implemented.
### Structure
The class should inherit from the BaseDecoration class.
### Methods
```__init__()```

An instance of the Plant class will have 5 comfort and its price is 10.

##    4. DecorationRepository
In the file decoration_repository.py the class DecorationRepository should be implemented. It is a repository for the decorations that are in the aqua shop.
### Structure
#### The class should have the following attributes:
    • decorations: list – empty list that will contain all decorations (objects).
### Methods
```__init__()```

The __init__ method should have an empty list of decorations. 
#### add(decoration)
    • Adds a decoration object in the list.
#### remove(decoration)
    • Removes the decoration object from the list if it exists and returns True, otherwise returns False.
#### find_by_type(decoration_type: str)
    • Returns the first decoration of the given type if there is. Otherwise, returns a message "None".

##    5. BaseFish
In the base_fish.py file the class BaseFish should be implemented. It is a base class of any type of fish, and it should not be able to be instantiated.
### Structure
#### The class should have the following attributes:
    • name: string - passed upon initialization. If the name is empty string, raise a ValueError with message "Fish name cannot be an empty string."
        ◦ All passed names would be unique and it will not be necessary to check if a given name already exists.
    • species: string - passed upon initialization. If the species is empty string, raise a ValueError with message "Fish species cannot be an empty string."
    • size: int - passed upon initialization. 
    • price: float - passed upon initialization. It represents the price of the fish. If the price is equal to or below 0, raise a ValueError with message "Price cannot be equal to or below zero."
### Methods
```__init__(name: str, species: str, size: int, price: float)```

The __init__ method should have a name, a species, a size and a price.  
#### eat()

    • name: string - passed upon initialization. If the name is empty string, raise a ValueError with message: "Aquarium name cannot be an empty string."
        ◦ All passed names would be unique and it will not be necessary to check if a given name already exists.
    • capacity:  int - passed upon initialization. It represents the number of fish an aquarium can have.
    • decorations: list - empty list upon initialization that will contain all the decorations (objects).
    • fish: list - empty list upon initialization that will contain all the fish (objects).

#### add_decoration(decoration)
Adds a decoration object in the Aquarium.
#### feed()
The feed() method feeds all fish in the aquarium.

## Problem 3. Unit Tests - [Solution](https://github.com/borislavstoychev/Soft_Uni/tree/master/soft_uni_OOP/EXAM_10_04_2020/testing)
You will be provided with another skeleton for this problem. Import the new skeleton and write tests for the Train class. The class will have some methods, fields and one constructor, which are working properly. You are ***NOT ALLOWED*** to change any class. Cover the whole class with unit tests to make sure that the class is working as intended. Submit only the test folder.
