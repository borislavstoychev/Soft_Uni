    Problem 3. Players and Monsters
Your task is to create the following game hierarchy:

and submit in judge a zip file, containing a separate file for each of the classes using the structure shown below:

Create a class Hero. It should contain the following attributes:
    • username - string
    • level - int
Override the __repr__() method of the base class so it returns: "{name} of type {class_name} has level {level}"



Test Code:
        hero = Hero("H", 4)
        print(hero.username)
        print(hero.level)
        print(str(hero))
        elf = Elf("E", 4)
        print(str(elf))
        print(elf.__class__.__bases__[0].__name__)
        print(elf.username)
        print(elf.level)
Output:
        H
        4
        H of type Hero has level 4
        E of type Elf has level 4
        Hero
        E
        4
