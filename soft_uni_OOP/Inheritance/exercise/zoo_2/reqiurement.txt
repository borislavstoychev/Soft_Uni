and submit in judge a zip file, containing a separate file for each of the classes using the structure shown below:
Follow the diagram and create all of the classes. Each of them, except the Animal class, should inherit from another class. The Animal class should have private attribute name - string and getter for the name.
Every class should have constructor, which accepts one parameter: name
Test Code:
            mammal = Mammal("Stella")
            print(mammal.__class__.__bases__[0].__name__)
            print(mammal.name)
            print(mammal._Animal__name)
            lizard = Lizard("John")
            print(lizard.__class__.__bases__[0].__name__)
            print(lizard.name)
            print(lizard._Animal__name)
Output:
            Animal
            Stella
            Stella
            Reptile
            John
